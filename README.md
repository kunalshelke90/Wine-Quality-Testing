# Wine Quality Prediction


This project focuses on predicting the quality of wines based on various physicochemical properties.The dataset used in this project is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which is publicly available. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kunalshelke90/Wine-Quality-Testing.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
    cd Wine-Quality-Testing
```

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
    conda create -p myenv python=3.8 -y
```


```bash
   conda activate myenv
```
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Start the Flask application:

```bash
    python app.py
```
2. Access the application:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to interact with the application. or http://127.0.0.1:8080

# Steps included in this project:

    Importing Lib

# ## Workflows

1. update config.yaml
   
2. update schema.yaml
   
3. update params.yaml
 
4. update the entity

5. update the configuration manager in src config
  
6. update the components
  
7. update the pipeline
   
8. update the main.py

9. update the app.py

# Learning

I learned how machine learning explainability can be used to take a deep dive into machine learning models and extract key insights that can be used in the real world. I also learned that the highest quality of wine had an alchoal content between 12% - 15%.
